## Instructions

Currently the game is unrunnable, due to errors in Gamemaker Studios' compilation functionality. You can open the game by loading it as a GMS project and pressing the run button, however this requires installing GMS, which I don't necessarily recommend. This is more a testament to three friends who made a small, but fun game a long time ago for a hackathon.
